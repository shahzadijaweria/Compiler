# Compiler
Compiler was constructed by me as  a term project in JAVA. It takes a file as an input (see the sample input file), then generate a lexer for it, then develop analyzer for it and finally generate the source code using Virtual machine. Once the source code is generated, then the file will be processed and return the output in human readable form.
